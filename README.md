# simple-spaceshooter


This game is a simple project that I made using python and pygame library! Maybe someday I will make a multiplayer version of this, but right now I'm not that interested on working more in this project. The entire game is made with pure python, that means that this game doesn't uses custom sprites, so all the graphics, ships, aliens and so on are entire coded! Enjoy!
